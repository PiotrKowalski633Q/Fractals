# Fractals

## About

The Fractals project is a simple fractal generator, written in C++. It uses OpenCL technology to distribute work across devices and is capable of visualizing generated fractals with the use of SFML library.

## Authors

## Features

- interactive fractal generation for mandelbrot and julia sets
- keyboard controls allowing zooming in and out, movement in all directions and changing between fractals at runtime

## Controls
- _left shift_ - zoom in
- _spacebar_ - zoom out
- _W_ - move up
- _A_ - move to the left
- _S_ - move down
- _D_ - move to the right
- _Q_ - switch between fractals
- _Escape_ - exit application
